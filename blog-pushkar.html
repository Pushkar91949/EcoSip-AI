    <h1>The Harmful Effects of Disposable Cups</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Disposable cups have become an everyday necessity for many people, from grabbing a coffee on the go to enjoying a quick drink. While these cups are convenient, they come with hidden costs—most notably, the significant environmental damage they cause. These cups may seem harmless in the moment, but their long-lasting negative effects on the environment and human health should be a major cause for concern.</p>
        <p>In this blog, we’ll explore the damaging impact of disposable cups, look at the alternatives available, and provide you with actionable steps to reduce your personal waste footprint.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>The Environmental Crisis</h2>
        <p>It’s easy to overlook the environmental impact of disposable cups because they seem so harmless in their small, single-use form. However, most disposable cups are made from paper or plastic, and while paper cups might seem more eco-friendly, they are typically coated with a layer of polyethylene plastic, making them difficult to recycle.</p>
        <p>These cups contribute to deforestation for the production of paper, and the energy required to create them is substantial. According to recent studies, billions of disposable cups end up in landfills every year, where they take over 50 years to break down. Worse, when they do decompose, they often release harmful chemicals into the soil and water systems, further degrading our environment.</p>

        <h2>Health Hazards</h2>
        <p>Another often overlooked issue with disposable cups is their impact on human health. Many disposable cups, especially those lined with plastic, contain chemicals like BPA (bisphenol A) that can leach into hot beverages. Studies have shown that BPA can mimic estrogen in the body, leading to hormonal imbalances that may increase the risk of certain cancers, reproductive issues, and other health problems.</p>
        <p>Although some manufacturers have moved to BPA-free plastics, alternatives like BPS (bisphenol S) are often used, and they carry similar risks. When people drink from disposable cups regularly, they are unknowingly exposing themselves to these harmful substances.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Disposable cups don't just harm humans—they also pose a major threat to wildlife. Cups and other single-use plastic products often end up in oceans and rivers, where marine life mistake them for food. Consuming these plastics can lead to severe injuries, malnutrition, and even death for marine animals.</p>
        <p>Birds, turtles, and fish are among the most affected species. The ingestion of plastic particles can block their digestive systems, causing them to starve. Worse, as plastics break down into smaller microplastics, they are increasingly consumed by animals at all levels of the food chain, eventually making their way back into the food we eat.</p>

        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>The good news is that we have the power to change this. By making simple adjustments to our daily habits, we can significantly reduce the demand for disposable cups. Replacing single-use cups with reusable alternatives like stainless steel, glass, or bamboo can make a huge difference. These materials are not only safer for your health but also much more sustainable in the long run.</p>
        <p>Many coffee shops and businesses now offer discounts to customers who bring their own reusable cups, incentivizing the switch. You can also take steps at home to eliminate disposable cups from your routine by using washable mugs and tumblers instead.</p>
        <p>Finally, as a community, we can raise awareness about the negative impacts of disposable cups and encourage more sustainable practices in our workplaces, schools, and local businesses. Together, we can reduce waste and protect our planet.</p>
