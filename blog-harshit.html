    <h1>The Harm of Plastic Cups</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Plastic cups are widely used across the globe, from parties to fast food joints, and their convenience makes them a popular choice for drinks. However, the negative consequences of using plastic cups are alarming and affect both the environment and human health. In this blog, we explore how these everyday items can contribute to environmental destruction and why we need to reduce or eliminate their use.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Environmental Devastation</h2>
        <p>Plastic cups are a major contributor to pollution around the world. While many of them are marketed as recyclable, the reality is that only a small fraction of plastic is ever recycled. Plastic cups are made from non-biodegradable materials, meaning they do not break down naturally in the environment.</p>
        <p>When plastic cups end up in landfills or the ocean, they can persist for hundreds of years, releasing harmful toxins into the soil and water as they break down. As a result, plastic cups contribute significantly to land and water pollution, which harms ecosystems and wildlife. The production process of plastic itself also depletes fossil fuels, contributing to climate change.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Health Hazards of Plastic Cups</h2>
        <p>Plastic cups often contain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which can leach into beverages, especially when exposed to heat. These chemicals are endocrine disruptors, meaning they can interfere with the body’s hormone systems, leading to reproductive health issues, developmental problems, and even certain cancers.</p>
        <p>Although some plastic cups are labeled BPA-free, alternatives like BPS (Bisphenol S) and other similar chemicals are often used, which carry similar health risks. The frequent consumption of drinks from plastic cups, especially hot beverages, increases the exposure to these toxic chemicals, raising concerns for long-term health effects.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Impact on Marine Life</h2>
        <p>The ocean is the final resting place for millions of plastic cups and other plastic waste every year. Marine animals, including fish, birds, and sea turtles, mistake plastic debris for food. When they ingest plastic, it can cause blockages, malnutrition, and even death. Additionally, plastics break down into smaller microplastics, which enter the food chain as smaller creatures consume them, leading to contamination that can eventually reach humans.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, plastics in the ocean absorb toxins from the water, making them even more harmful to wildlife. These chemicals can accumulate in the bodies of animals, weakening their immune systems and causing long-term damage to ecosystems.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Why We Need to Act</h2>
        <p>While the use of plastic cups may seem like a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, the cumulative effect of billions of cups being used and discarded every day is immense. To reduce the harmful impact of plastic cups, it’s essential to switch to more sustainable options, such as reusable cups made from stainless steel, bamboo, or glass. These alternatives are durable, non-toxic, and can be used for years, significantly reducing waste.</p>
        <p>As individuals, we can make a difference by refusing plastic cups when we’re offered them, encouraging businesses to use eco-friendly alternatives, and promoting the use of reusable drinkware. With greater awareness and action, we can protect our planet and health from the devastating effects of plastic cups.</p>
